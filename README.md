### fix (still)  
---

## Vim stuff (current)
Maybe switch to vim instead of nvim for writing tex? This shouldn't need more than a few copy and pastes  
trailing spaces on vim would be nice  
some of the opts are very weird still in .vimrc  

## Stuff that is just everything else idk

make alt init.lua's for different colorschemes and less clutter in plugins/install.lua
