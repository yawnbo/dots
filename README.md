## Dotfiles

Clone repo
```
git clone https://github.com/yawnbo/dots.git ~/
```
Stow files (this REMOVES and OVERWRITES files do NOT use without backing up)
```
cd ~/dots
stow --adopt . && \
git restore .
```
these are probably ~~NOT~~ stable  
### fix (still)  
Lazy needs plugin abstraction this is horrible to read  
I think jdtls still doesn't work on arch but works on mac???
