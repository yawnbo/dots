### fix (still)  
---  
Maybe switch to typst instead of latex/word/markdown? Needs proper snippets and I don't know if they exist, but a vimtex replacement exists [here](https://github.com/niuiic/typst-preview.nvim)  
avante nvim if i feel like paying for api use 
just actually do some work instead of this idk
